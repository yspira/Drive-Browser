# High Level Specification
In this project we will create browser extensions that will enable the user to easily select content in the page they are browsing to like some text, an image, and more and to store that informaiton in a special file in their Google Drive.

Whenever a user decides to store some information they will mark it and have some special command to allow to "store to my Google Drive".

The stored data will be appended to the special "Collected Info" file in Google Drive as a new entry alongside source of the data (like the URL) and a date and time in which the data was stored.

This app is supposed to be an easy system to collect important notes, text or data that is important to the user and to easily aggregate it for future use.

We want to create extensions that will run on the Edge browser and Chrome.

Once the user installs the extension they should authenticate once to their Google and from their things should just work.

Later features of this application might inlcude:
- compresing the data for efficient storage
- allowing LLMs to use the data file as a source of informaiton on the user to better answer their queries 
- browsing stored entries 
- searching through the stored entries
